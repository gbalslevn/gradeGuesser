Used this project to learn about neural networks. I followed Andrej KarpathyÂ´s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) on micrograd to do this. 
Implemented a way for the neural network to guess the probability of getting a grade between 0-20 based on some inputs from a [UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)
